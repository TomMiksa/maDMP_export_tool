# maDMP_export_tool

In this project the RDA DMP Common Standard was evaluated by mapping it to funder templates and by implementing a tool
that exports information from existing DMP tools into maDMP format.

# How the Tool works and its Configuration

To run the tool first a connection to the mysql database has to be made. Therefore, go to the ```src\main\resources\application.properties``` file. Here you find three values to configure:
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/DATABASE-NAME?useJDBCCompliantTimezoneShift=true&useLegacyDatetimeCode=false&serverTimezone=Europe/Vienna
spring.datasource.username=DATABASE-USERNAME
spring.datasource.password=DATABASE-USERPASSWORD
```
Replace ```DATABASE-NAME``` with the name given to the Roadmap database. Then set the username and the (if required) password.

With this the configuration is done. Upon starting the application a website under ```localhost:8080``` can be accessed.
